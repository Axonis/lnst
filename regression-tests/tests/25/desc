proper signal handling for bg processes in net namespaces

When running a background process in a new network namespace signal handlers
were inherited from the namespace process lnst-slave which caused issues when
calling the interrupt command on the background process.

This test uses two recipes - one for run command and one for run test module.
It also uses a custom IcmpPing test module that runs the ping twice this way we
can test that the whole background process is interrupted, not just the
currently running ping process.
