Check corner case in matching algorithm

This test checks that controller fails if it runs a recipe with just one
machine specified. The controller should fail.

UPDATE:
This is now supported in new lnst versions, the controller therefore shoudln't
fail. Changing the recipe.xml and run.sh to reflect this.
