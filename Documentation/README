This directory contains useful documentation to help you understand how 
Linux Network Stack Test (LNST) works and show you some hints how to start 
using it.

Description of the files in Documentation directory follows.


LNSTIntro.html
--------------

General introduction to the LNST including all concepts required for 
understanding the framework.

IMPORTANT NOTE:

The document contains few interesting pictures that were stored in gzipped XML 
format and conversion to png is needed before viewing them. The pictures were 
created with Dia (program for drawing structured diagrams [1]). We have 
provided you a script named "lnst_intro_images.sh" to help you with the 
conversion. First install the dia package for your distribution and then 
just run the script and you'll be ready to read the document with all the 
fancy pictures.
